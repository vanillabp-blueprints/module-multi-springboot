/**
 * A workflow module carries its configuration per environment, and this test is the proof:
 * with the profile {@code test} active, the value from
 * {@code loan-approval/loan-approval-test.yaml} arrives rather than the one from
 * {@code loan-approval/loan-approval.yaml}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The profile is <em>included</em> rather than set, because the active profile already
 * names the BPMS this build runs against and that choice must survive. What the module
 * files react to is every active profile, so both apply.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Worth knowing, and the reason this test exists: the profile lives in the file NAME.
 * Inside a workflow module's configuration file {@code spring.config.activate.on-profile}
 * has no effect, so a multi-document YAML would quietly deliver the wrong value.
 * </p>
