/**
 * The beans of a workflow module are named after the module, and this test is what keeps it
 * that way.
 *
 * <p>
 * Both modules have a class called {@code Service} and one called {@code ApiController}.
 * With Spring's default names the second module to be registered ends the boot, and the
 * message names a bean nobody wrote. Each module therefore generates its bean names as
 * {@code <module-id>_<SimpleName>}, which is also what a stack trace or an actuator listing
 * shows from then on.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The application starting at all already proves that nothing collides. What this test adds
 * is the naming itself: a module which quietly falls back to the default names works today
 * and collides with the next module somebody adds.
