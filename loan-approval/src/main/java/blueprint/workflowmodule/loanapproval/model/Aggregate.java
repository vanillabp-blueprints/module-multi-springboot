/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * The class is annotated {@code @NoSyncWithBPMS}, so no attribute of it reaches the BPMS.
 * The model gives none a reason to: it runs from the start event through one service task
 * to the end, and no expression in it reads the aggregate. What the BPMS holds is the
 * aggregate's ID, which VanillaBP always shares because that is how it finds the workflow
 * again. An attribute gets {@code @SyncWithBPMS} the day a model starts reading it.
 * </p>
